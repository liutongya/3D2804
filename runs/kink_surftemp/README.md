## Wind stress amplitude 
Changes from 0.1 to 0.2 as a biomodal sinusoid

## SST relaxation
South (-1,1), north (9,11) with 10C difference but at y=100 (4,6) and at y=150 8.5C. The point was to have the isopycnal slopes change centered around y=150km.

## North temp relax
The stratification below the thermocline changes as
| Depth   | Temperature |
| ------- | ----------- |
| -154    | 8.55         |
| -471.5  | 8.45           |
| -2933.5 | -1          |
